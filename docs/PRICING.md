# MCPShield Pricing

MCPShield is open source. Monetization is via **paid pilots and support** during the Pilot phase.

## Community (Open Source) — Free

Everything in this repo is available for free:

- Local lockfile (`mcp.lock.json`) management and drift detection
- Artifact verification for npm-based MCP servers
- Deterministic static scans (typosquat signals, suspicious patterns, install hooks)
- Dependency vulnerability reporting (OSV) and policy enforcement (`policy.yaml`)
- CI-friendly output (`--json`) and GitHub Code Scanning output (`--sarif`)

## Pilot Pro (Paid Support) — $29/repo/month

Pilot Pro is a support offering, not a separate binary. You get:

- Onboarding and CI integration help (GitHub Actions templates, gating rules)
- Policy tuning for your risk tolerance (false-positive reduction, allow/deny rules)
- Faster response times for issues and security reports
- Private roadmap access and early feature review

Volume discounts and annual billing are available.

## Enterprise (Custom)

If you need contractual support, procurement-friendly billing, or roadmap-driven features (for example: hosted reporting, alerts, managed policy packs, or runtime guardrails), we can scope it.
